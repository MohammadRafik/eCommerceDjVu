refactor the repetetive and bad code                                                                            -i did a lot of this, still got more to go tho

add back button when on product page

security, validating user inputs!!!

-rename products app to catalog

-when resizing to smaller size the page should show less than 1 card per row

-slideshow is bugged when window size is reduced, this happens when the picture doesnt fit a nd as it slides to the new image it shows parts of the old one...

when i drag the vuper slides to move them it still registers as a click and opens the page,             -temporarily fixed by disabling the drag feature.... xd

the standard data format between forntend and backend should be json
