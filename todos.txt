add back button when on product page

refactor the repetetive and bad code                                    -i did a lot of this, still got more to go tho

security, good error messages. summary: validating user inputs!!!

-deleting a category should not have a cascading effect         -wrong, it should, its deleting the child categories

-products should be able to be not in a category section        -done

-need to clean up expired carts in the database

-rename products app to catalog

-i just realized i forgot to take quanitity of each product into account when checking out or adding to cart

-featured products dont show when sorted by category, example when i click on monitor the featured mointors dont show up as normal items, they should

-when resizing to phone size some things dont work as intended, adn teh catagory list gets blocked i think


important:
when i drag the vuper slides to move them it still registers as a click and opens the page,             -temporarily fixed by disabling the drag feature.... xd
